## Learned User Preferences

- Do not run `git commit` or `git push` without explicit permission; when asked to commit and push, open a pull request instead of pushing directly to the default branch.
- For npm-package maintenance in this repo: split uncommitted work into phased semver commits, update `CHANGELOG.md` and `package.json`, and ask before releasing if the version was not bumped for the change set.
- During maintenance commits, do not stage `docs/` unless the user explicitly asks; leave `package-vsix.sh` untracked unless they ask to include it.
- User often starts work with `/light-prompt` for a tight structured prompt (~200 tokens) and uses parallel swarms for multi-part implementation or research; never spawn subagents on Fast model variants.
- For chat transport across machines or repos (often the `bergamota` workspace), use the Cursor Sync extension Chats sidebar, not the deprecated `/transport-chat` skill workflow (standalone `~/.cursor/skills/transport-chat` removed in v0.7.0).
- For substantial features, use superpowers brainstorming then writing-plans; store specs and plans under `docs/superpowers/`.
- Refreshes `AGENTS.md` via continual-learning and the agents-memory-updater subagent when asked.
- Prefer concise, high-quality English responses; do not use emojis.
- Chat bundle import (local file and private Gist) should not prompt or auto-run Reload Window. Transcript import can still offer reload when `cursorSync.transcripts.autoReloadAfterImport` is set or the user picks it.
- Do not purge per-conversation `cursorDiskKV` rows at import time. That breaks importing the same chat across workspaces on one machine.
- Imported Composer chats must not keep or show a Request ID. Treat imports as synthetic on the destination workspace (clear bubble `requestId`, rebind `workspaceIdentifier`, stamp current createdAt/lastUpdated/lastOpenedAt).
- Automated/Gist chat import must not call `developer.importChat` or `developer.bulkImportChats` (those open file/folder pickers). Use storage-level native JSON import. In a running IDE, register the composer with `composer.createNew` (single options object → `composerService.createComposer`). `composer.createComposer` is not a registered command. Call createNew only when `partialState` has real conversation content (`conversationMap` or `fullConversationHeadersOnly`). Empty `partialState` wipes disk-restored chats. Never pass tilde-base64 `conversationState` strings in `partialState`. Open with `composer.openComposer` and `openExistingOnly: true` for the disk-written id.

## Learned Workspace Facts

- `cursor-sync` is a VS Code extension (publisher MarceloBarella) that syncs Cursor user config and selected `~/.cursor` assets to a private GitHub Gist.
- v0.8.0+ native chat JSON is the transport format: `version: 1`, `conversationState` + `blobs`. TypeScript read/write lives in SQLite (`src/native-chat-json/`). Hard cutover rejects ChatBundle (`schemaVersion` / `type: chat-persistence`). Spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-02-native-chat-json-design.md`, plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-02-native-chat-json.md`. Private Gist file `cursor-chat.json` (encryption wraps native JSON). Built-in IDE export/import is in `docs/cursor-native-export-import-chat.md`.
- Bundled Python under `resources/transport-chat/scripts/` is not used for extension chat disk import. Tool/MCP fidelity comes from export `blobs`, not JSONL or legacy `diskKvSnapshot`.
- Sync failure toasts (push, pull, Sync Now, scheduled) offer Debug with Cursor via `src/sync-debug.ts`: sanitized prompt, Composer prefill when available, clipboard fallback otherwise (v0.7.3+).
- Chat import uses native JSON (`version: 1`, `conversationState` + `blobs`, optional `storeDb`) per `docs/cursor-native-export-import-chat.md`. Flow: write blobs, `syncImportedComposerSidebar` (global and workspace `composer.composerHeaders`), then hydrate `composerData` before open. Default path is TS protobuf hydration (`cursorSync.chatImport.useProtobufHydration`, default true): build a non-empty `conversationMap` from `conversationState` + export `bubbles`, keep `blobEncryptionKey`. IDE fallback (`cursorSync.chatImport.useIdeHydration`, default false) uses `composer.createComposer` when protobuf hydration is off. `strictDiskGates` fails when the map stays empty. Decode hex `cursorDiskKV` via `parseComposerDataKvJson`. After activation, `repairComposerDataAfterActivation` re-persists hydrated `conversationMap`, headers, `conversationState`, encryption keys, and `status: completed` when the IDE clobbers `composerData`. `ensureNativeChatStoreDb` writes `~/.cursor/chats/<workspace-key>/<composerId>/store.db` (export snapshot or golden template) so `getComposerHandleById` does not stall on Loading Chat. Inline activation: live `composer.createNew` registration (SQLite-only header/`composerData` writes get clobbered by the IDE in-memory composer list while Cursor is running), `openExistingOnly: true`, `stagePending: false`, manifest v2. On reload Cursor serializes in-memory composer back to global `composer.composerHeaders`; activation partial state must preserve destination `workspaceIdentifier`, header `name`, and timestamps after rich disk hydration, not only SQLite rows. Do not pass base64 `conversationState` in `partialState` (`createComposer` protobuf `.toBinary()` expects a decoded object; restore the string on disk after).
- Cursor Composer runtime (3.7.x+): UI renders from `composerData.fullConversationHeadersOnly` plus per-bubble `bubbleId:<composerId>:<uuid>` `cursorDiskKV` rows. On-disk `conversationMap` is often empty even for working chats. Assistant/tool bodies are blob-backed via export `conversationState` + `blobs` (`~`+base64 protobuf → `agentKv:blob:<hash>`), not transcript JSONL alone. `composer.openComposer` / `getComposerHandleById` use in-memory `composerDataService`, not a disk load-by-id. Global `state.vscdb` `cursorDiskKV` can be partially corrupt. Use exact-key / `key IN (...)` lookups, never `LIKE 'prefix%'` scans (triggers "database disk image is malformed"). When global `integrity_check` fails, write/import `cursorDiskKV` to workspace `state.vscdb` instead and promote diskKv `composerData` into ItemTable before activation.
- Feature specs and implementation plans for this repo live under `docs/superpowers/specs/` and `docs/superpowers/plans/` (e.g. protobuf hydration plan `2026-06-05-protobuf-conversation-hydration.md`).
- `cursor-detective` is a personal read-only forensics skill at `~/.cursor/skills/cursor-detective/` (explicit `/cursor-detective`); probe to maximum depth in one pass (workbench bundle, DBs, module paths) without asking permission to go deeper; writes `.cursor/plans/detective-<theme>.plan.md` in the workspace; design spec in-repo, not shipped in the VSIX.
- Git and release workflow for this repo is defined in `.cursor/rules/git.mdc`.
- Keep `package-lock.json` version aligned with `package.json` on releases; `.worktrees` belongs in `.gitignore`.
- Sidebar UX is webview-based with Sync, Chats, and Settings tabs (`src/sidebar/`). `refreshSidebar()` updates that webview only, not Cursor's native Composer history list. Native Composer history reads global `composer.composerHeaders` → `allComposers[]` filtered by `workspaceIdentifier.id` (workspace-only merge leaves imports invisible). Post-import `queueSidebarWriteback` stages pending entries (`~/.cursor/import-activation/sidebar-pending/`); `flushPendingSidebarWriteback` replays on `extension.activate`. Do not flush pending writeback before autoreload—it clears the queue and breaks post-reload native sidebar replay. Gist/local chat paths use native JSON (`cursor-chat.json`, `cursorSync.exportChatBundle` / `restoreNativeChatsBatch`). Composer titles come from `allComposers[].name`; `buildChatBundle` sets `bundle.title` via `resolveComposerConversationTitle` (snapshot header name wins over transcript), and `headersPayloadForImport` preserves snapshot `name` when non-empty instead of letting `bundle.title` overwrite it. See `.cursor/plans/detective-composer-chat-title.plan.md`, `.cursor/plans/detective-chat-import-sidebar.plan.md`, and `.cursor/plans/detective-cross-workspace-chat-import.plan.md`.
- v0.7.5+ optional client-side encryption for chat Gist files (`cursorSync.chatGist.encrypt`, `cursorSync.setChatEncryptionPassword`, Argon2id + AES-256-GCM via `hash-wasm`); plaintext kinds `cursor-chat` / `cursor-chat-collection` in v0.8.0+.

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

This repo is a **VS Code/Cursor extension** (not a standalone web app). Cloud agents can fully verify the dev toolchain with npm; running the Extension Development Host (F5) requires a local Cursor/VS Code GUI.

### Toolchain

- **Node.js 20+** and **npm** (`package-lock.json`; use `npm ci`).
- **Python 3** on PATH for repo `tests/` (`python3 -m unittest discover -s tests`) and bundled `resources/transport-chat/scripts/` (stdlib only).
- **pytest** is optional — only needed for `resources/transport-chat/tests/` (not run in CI).

### Standard commands

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Install | `npm ci` |
| Lint | `npm run lint` (`tsc --noEmit`) |
| Test | `npm test` (Vitest, 369 tests) |
| Python tests | `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py' -v` |
| Build | `npm run build` → `dist/extension.js` |
| Watch | `npm run watch` (esbuild; pair with F5 locally) |
| Package | `npm run package` → `cursor-sync-<version>.vsix` |

### Running the extension

- **Local IDE:** `.vscode/launch.json` — **Run Extension** (preLaunchTask `watch-extension`) or **Run Extension (build once)**.
- **Cloud VM:** No headless extension host; use `npm test` + `npm run build`/`package` as the automated verification path. GitHub Gist sync E2E needs a PAT via **Cursor Sync: Configure GitHub** in a running IDE.

### Gotchas

- `npm run package` warns about missing `LICENSE` file; harmless for dev builds.
- Some Vitest cases spawn `python3` for SQLite/chat disk helpers; ensure Python 3 is installed.
- Do not add `npm run watch`, `npm run dev`, or test commands to the VM update script — only dependency refresh (`npm ci`).
